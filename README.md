# SIMON Project

## Overview

This is my first project on WDI16 at General Assembly. I chose to build a SIMON game.

When the users come to the site, they see an intro screen with the name of the game, and a **PLAY** button. Once the click **PLAY**, the game board is shown with some instructions on how to play.
